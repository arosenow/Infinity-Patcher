Executable version for windows on the right hand side under releases

This tool inserts labels into Infinity Engine mods to make them compatible with the mod manager Project Infinity. 
It appends the Labels = GloballyUnique to the ini, or creates the ini if necessary, to make my favourite mods compatible.
This is especially helpful for big mods such as Sword Coast Stratagems or Tweaks n tricks.

*Warning, these fake labels will only work for the same version of the mod, so you can't really package an install order, it's for convenience and people who regularly update their mods for personal use.
After a mod update you'll need to check the components still align with your choices, because if an author adds new components, the labels will be misaligned because they're based on numerical order.
